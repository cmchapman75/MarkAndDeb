			<h1>Congratulations!</h1>

			<h2>You are receiving Black Walnut seedlings for Christmas!</h2>

		  <p>Okay, so they won’t actually be here for Christmas.  I mean any ass-hole with half a 
			  brain should realize that seedlings can’t be planted in the snow, so why give them out at Christmas. </p>

		  <p>So, it is more like Christmas in July.  Okay, okay, that is just dumb because July would be way too late to plant seedlings.  
			  Any ass-hole would know that too.  But no one ever says “it’s like Christmas in May.”</p>
		  <p>Okay, so maybe that is what we are saying now.</p>

	     <p>So, here are your seedlings, and now your work begins.</p>

		   <p>First you need to decide on where you are going to plant your seedlings.  Just remember, they are the kind of assholes

	     <p>Sit back and enjoy watching them grow.  Okay, so maybe not all day, every day.  You have other work to do asshole.</p>
